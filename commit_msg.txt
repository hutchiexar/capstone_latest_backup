Refactor multiple scripts and templates for improved functionality and organization

- Updated various scripts including `fix_drivervehicle_field.py`, `fix_duplication.py`, `fix_is_active.py`, `fix_old_pd.py`, `fix_operator_potpot.py`, and `fix_operator_review.py` to enhance their logic and performance.
- Refined the `initialize_violation_types.py` for better initialization of violation types.
- Made adjustments to operator-related scripts such as `operator_create_updated.py` to streamline operator management.
- Enhanced test coverage in `test_popups.py` to ensure popups function correctly across the application.
- Updated multiple HTML templates to improve user interface and experience, including driver and operator management pages.
- Refactored views in `traffic_violation_system/views.py` and `traffic_violation_system/violation_type_views.py` for better separation of concerns and maintainability.

This commit aims to enhance the overall code quality and user experience across the application.
