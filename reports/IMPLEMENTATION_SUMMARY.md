# Role-Based Reports Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a role-based reporting system for the Traffic Violation System. This feature allows different types of users to access, generate, and schedule reports based on their roles in the system.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Database Models
- **Report**: Core model storing report metadata, query templates, and visualization settings
- **ReportPermission**: Role-based access control for reports
- **ReportSchedule**: Report scheduling configuration
- **GeneratedReport**: Storage for generated PDF reports

### 2. User Interface
- **Dashboard**: Central reports dashboard showing reports by category
- **Report Generator**: User interface for generating reports with date range selection and export options
- **Report Scheduler**: Interface for scheduling reports with frequency options
- **PDF Report Template**: Well-structured template for PDF report generation

### 3. Backend Logic
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Reports are only visible to users with appropriate roles
- **PDF Generation**: PDF reports are generated using xhtml2pdf
- **Report Scheduling**: System for scheduled report generation
- **Email Notifications**: Automated emails with attached PDF reports

### 4. Management Commands
- **create_sample_reports**: Command to create sample reports for testing
- **run_scheduled_reports**: Command to run scheduled reports at specified intervals
