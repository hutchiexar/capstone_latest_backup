# Environment Variables for Render Deployment

When deploying your Traffic Violation System to Render, you need to set up the following environment variables. Some of these will be automatically configured through the render.yaml file, but others you'll need to add manually through the Render dashboard.

## Automatically Configured Variables (in render.yaml)

- `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`: Set to `CAPSTONE_PROJECT.postgresql_settings`
- `SECRET_KEY`: Automatically generated by Render
- `DEBUG`: Set to "False" for production
- `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`: Set to ".onrender.com"
- `DATABASE_URL`: Automatically set from the PostgreSQL database
- `RENDER`: Set to "True" to indicate Render deployment
- `PYTHON_VERSION`: Set to "3.9.0"

## Variables You Need to Add Manually

Add these through the Render dashboard in your web service Environment section:

### Email Service Configuration
- `BREVO_API_KEY`: Your Brevo API key for sending emails
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`: The email address used as sender

### Email Verification Settings
- `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_CODE_LENGTH`: Length of verification codes (e.g., 6)
- `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_HOURS`: Hours until verification expires (e.g., 24)

### ID Analyzer

- `ID_ANALYZER_RESTRICTED_KEY`: Your ID Analyzer restricted key (if used)

### Other API Keys (if applicable)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: If you're using OpenAI services
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: If you're using Google services

### Payment Processing (if applicable)
- `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`: Your Stripe public key

## How to Add Environment Variables in Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard and select your web service
2. Click on the "Environment" tab
3. Add each key-value pair in the "Environment Variables" section
4. Click "Save Changes" when done

Make sure to keep these values secure and never commit them directly to your repository.
