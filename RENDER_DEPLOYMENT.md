# Deploying Traffic Violation System to Render

This project is configured for easy deployment to Render using Blueprint deployment.

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub
2. Log in to your Render dashboard
3. Click "New" â†’ "Blueprint"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Render will automatically set up your web service and PostgreSQL database
6. Add your environment variables in the web service settings

## Important Updates

### Python Version
We've updated the Python version in `render.yaml` from 3.9.0 to 3.10.0 to ensure compatibility with packages like `contourpy` and other dependencies.

### Dependency Conflicts Fixed
We've addressed multiple dependency conflicts:

1. **contourpy/matplotlib compatibility**: Updated Python version to 3.10.0
2. **pyparsing conflicts**: Created a simplified `requirements-fixed.txt` with compatible versions
3. **pyHanko/pyhanko-certvalidator conflicts**: After multiple attempts, updated to much older versions (pyHanko==0.17.0 and pyhanko-certvalidator==0.19.5)
4. **Fallback mechanism**: Created `requirements-minimal.txt` without problematic packages as a fallback
5. **Enhanced build.sh**: Updated to include multiple fallback options for dependency issues

These robust changes should ensure successful deployment even if some package conflicts persist.

## Files for Render Deployment

- `render.yaml` - Defines services and their configurations
- `build.sh` - Enhanced build script with fallback mechanisms
- `CAPSTONE_PROJECT/postgresql_settings.py` - PostgreSQL-specific settings
- `requirements-fixed.txt` - Fixed dependencies file to resolve conflicts
- `requirements-minimal.txt` - Minimal dependencies for fallback

## Post-Deployment

After deployment:
1. Test your application on the provided Render URL
2. Monitor logs for any errors
3. Set up continuous deployment as needed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter build failures, check the following:

1. **Python version compatibility**: Ensure your packages are compatible with Python 3.10.0
2. **Database connection**: Verify PostgreSQL connection settings
3. **Environment variables**: Make sure all required variables are set
4. **Build logs**: Review build logs for specific error messages

For more detailed troubleshooting, refer to `render_dependency_guide.md`.
