# Deploying Traffic Violation System to Render

This project is configured for easy deployment to Render using Blueprint deployment.

## Quick Deployment Steps

1. Ensure your code is pushed to GitHub
2. Log in to your Render dashboard
3. Click "New" â†’ "Blueprint"
4. Select your GitHub repository
5. Render will automatically set up your web service and PostgreSQL database
6. Add your environment variables in the web service settings

## Important Updates

### Python Version
We've updated the Python version in `render.yaml` from 3.9.0 to 3.10.0 to ensure compatibility with packages like `contourpy` and other dependencies.

### Dependency Conflicts Fixed
We've addressed multiple dependency conflicts:

1. **contourpy/matplotlib compatibility**: Updated Python version to 3.10.0
2. **pyparsing conflicts**: Created a simplified `requirements-fixed.txt` with compatible versions
3. **pyHanko/pyhanko-certvalidator conflicts**: Corrected versions to ensure compatibility (pyhanko-certvalidator==0.20.0 must be installed before pyHanko==0.17.0)
4. **Missing django-sslserver**: Added django-sslserver to all fallback mechanisms to prevent import errors
5. **Fallback mechanism**: Created `requirements-minimal.txt` with essential packages
6. **Enhanced build.sh**: Updated with proper installation order and more robust fallback options

### Graceful Degradation Implemented
Added `handle_pyhanko.py` utility that provides fallback mechanisms when pyHanko has issues:
- Automatically detects if pyHanko is properly installed
- Provides dummy implementation when unavailable
- Logs warnings instead of causing application crashes

These robust changes should ensure successful deployment even if some package conflicts persist.

## Files for Render Deployment

- `render.yaml` - Defines services and their configurations
- `build.sh` - Enhanced build script with fallback mechanisms
- `CAPSTONE_PROJECT/postgresql_settings.py` - PostgreSQL-specific settings
- `requirements-fixed.txt` - Fixed dependencies file to resolve conflicts
- `requirements-minimal.txt` - Minimal dependencies for fallback
- `handle_pyhanko.py` - Utility for graceful degradation of PDF signing functionality

## Post-Deployment

After deployment:
1. Test your application on the provided Render URL
2. Monitor logs for any errors
3. Set up continuous deployment as needed

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter build failures, check the following:

1. **Python version compatibility**: Ensure your packages are compatible with Python 3.10.0
2. **Database connection**: Verify PostgreSQL connection settings
3. **Environment variables**: Make sure all required variables are set
4. **Build logs**: Review build logs for specific error messages
