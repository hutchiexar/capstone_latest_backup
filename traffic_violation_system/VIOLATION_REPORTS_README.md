# Violation Reports Integration Guide

This README provides instructions on how to integrate the new Violation Records Report page into the Traffic Violation System.

## Files Created

1. **Templates:**
   - `templates/admin/reports/violations/violation_report.html` - Main report page template
   - `templates/admin/reports/violations/violation_report_pdf.html` - PDF export template

2. **Backend:**
   - `traffic_violation_system/reports/views.py` - Report views functionality
   - `traffic_violation_system/reports/__init__.py` - Package initialization
   - `traffic_violation_system/reports/urls.py` - URL patterns for the reports app
   - `traffic_violation_system/violation_reports_urls.py` - URL patterns for violation reports specifically

## Integration Steps

### 1. Install Required Dependencies

Make sure you have the `xhtml2pdf` package installed:

```bash
pip install xhtml2pdf
```

Add it to requirements.txt:

```
xhtml2pdf==0.2.11
```

### 2. Include URL Patterns

Add the following to your main `traffic_violation_system/urls.py` file:

```python
# Import the reports views
from traffic_violation_system.reports import views as report_views

# Include these in your urlpatterns
urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing URL patterns ...
    
    # Violation Reports
    path('management/violation-reports/', report_views.admin_violation_report, name='admin_violation_report'),
    path('management/violation-reports/export/', report_views.admin_violation_export, name='admin_violation_export'),
    
    # ... more URL patterns ...
]
```

Alternatively, you can use the provided `violation_reports_urls.py` file:

```python
# In traffic_violation_system/urls.py
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing URL patterns ...
    
    # Include violation reports URLs
    path('', include('traffic_violation_system.violation_reports_urls')),
    
    # ... more URL patterns ...
]
```

### 3. Template Modification (Already Done)

The sidebar menu in `templates/base.html` has already been updated to include a link to the new Violation Records Report.

### 4. Testing

1. Log in as an admin or supervisor user
2. Navigate to the Management section in the sidebar
3. Click on the "Reports" dropdown
4. Select "Violation Records"
5. Test filtering, pagination, and PDF export functionality

## Features

- Sorting by ID, violator name, and fine amount
- Pagination with configurable page size
- Summary statistics (total violations, total fine amount, paid violations, pending violations)
- PDF export functionality
- Mobile-responsive design

## Access Control

The Violation Records Report is only accessible to users with ADMIN or SUPERVISOR roles.
